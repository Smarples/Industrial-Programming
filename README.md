# Industrial-Programming
This was a 4th year course in which i completed 2 challenging courseworks by myself which consisted of a simple web browser that would have the basics of a normal web browser such as favourites, history, forward and back buttons etc. The other coursework was to analyse data from documents and output the data into graphs or lists dependant on the data that is being used.
